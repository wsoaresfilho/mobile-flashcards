# Flashcards Project

This app was produced for the "React Native" module of the React Nanodegree from Udacity.
The project was made following the requirements given by Udacity.

I hope you enjoy it!

## Getting Started

To get started you can simply clone the `mobile-flashcards` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `mobile-flashcards` repository. You can get git from [here][git].

You must have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [Node][node] and [NPM][npm].

Now that you have got `NPM`, you should install `yarn` also. Type on your command line:
```
npm install --global yarn
```

You will also need to install the Expo Client on your device to simulate the App.

The App was tested only on the Android Platform! I cannot garantee that it will work on IOS.
